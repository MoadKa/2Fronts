# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project uses a
four-part `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD` version scheme.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-06-20

First tagged release. Bundles the marketplace Wizard-of-Oz demand test and the
completion of the missed-call AI lead-recovery provisioning flow.

### Added
- Marketplace Wizard-of-Oz test page with a lead-capture form that posts to a
  Slack incoming webhook, for running a demand test before building fulfillment.
- Missed-call AI lead-recovery provisioning: Twilio voice and SMS webhooks, the
  `retry-provision` edge function, and supporting `automation_provisions` /
  `automation_provision_opt_outs` migrations.
- Regression test covering Twilio request-signature validation against Twilio's
  own documented worked example (previously a zero-coverage security boundary).

### Changed
- `automation_provisions.business_hours` column converted from `jsonb` to `text`
  to match every app-layer consumer (no production data affected).

### Fixed
- **STOP opt-outs were ignored.** The missed-call SMS sender (twilio-voice-webhook)
  never checked the opt-out table, so a caller who texted STOP could still be
  messaged — a TCPA/anti-spam compliance gap. Now enforced before every send.
- Opt-out insert errors in twilio-sms-webhook were silently swallowed; failures
  are now surfaced via `console.error`.
- `booking_link` is now validated at the database layer (`https?://`, max 200
  chars) since it is echoed verbatim into SMS sent to third parties and RLS only
  checked ownership, not content.
- twilio-voice-webhook no longer sends the missed-call SMS for non-active
  provisions.
- The missed-call edge-function test suite never actually ran (26 errors); the
  suite now executes and passes.
- QA fixes: catalog no longer shows empty when the demo automation is
  deactivated (ISSUE-001); the Slack capture payload no longer rejected with
  `400 no_text` (ISSUE-002); the "automation of interest" field now guides
  direct visitors (ISSUE-003).

### Known gaps
- No expiry/cleanup for abandoned-checkout `automation_provisions` rows stuck in
  `pending` (tracked in TODOS.md #8).
